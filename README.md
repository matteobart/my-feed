# my-feed

This was a terminal prototype app to see what was possible for my iOS app called feed. For the most part they run very similar code, except the iOS version has more features (and of course is written fully in Swift). This project originally started so that someone can have one social media app viewer. The idea was that there would be no need to have a bunch of social media accounts if all you do is follow a few public profiles. Why not use a single app to view all the profiles across all the platforms. Unfortunately, due to recent API changes in Facebook and Instagram I can not pull posts anymore. So the the prototype (and iOS app) ended up just being Twitter.

# Use 
To actually get the code to work, you will need to fill in the authentication for request for Twitter. Getting 
the API keys can all be found on the Twitter website.

Feel free to fork and modify the code as you see fit. This is a great example to see how the Twitter API works, a way to store persistant data using a TXT file, and how to create a simple terminal interface.
